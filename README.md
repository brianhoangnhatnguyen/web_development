### Here are all the topics I've learned:

## HTML:
### Tags:
* Strong/Bold Tag - make text **bolded.** (strong /strong)

* Emphasize/Italic Tag - make text *italicized.* (em /em)

* Div Tag - used for putting elements in a box. (div /div)

* Head Tag - head of the page. (head /head)

* Body Tag - body of the page. (body /body)

* Nav Tag - a semantic tag that targets the navigation bar. (nav /nav)

* Header Tag - a semantic tag that targets the heading. (header /header)

* Article Tag - a semantic tag that targets the content on a page. (article /article)

* Heading Tag - makes a heading. (h1 /h1, h2 /h2, h3 /h3, h4 /h4, h5 /h5, and h6 /h6)

* Doctype HTML - shows that the current document is HTML. (DOCTYPE html)

* HTML Tag - used to store all of the HTML code. (html /html)

* Button Tag - makes a button. (button /button)

* Anchor Tag - makes a hyperlink. The anchor tag is self closing, which means that there is no closing tag for it. (a href="examplelink.com" example text /a)

* Anchor Tag (target blank) - opens a hyperlink in another tab when clicked. (a href="examplelink.com" target="_blank" example text /a)

* Paragraph Tag - makes a paragraph. (p /p)

* Image Tag - displays an image. The image tag is self closing. (img src="https:://www.examplelink․com/examplelink․png")

* Ordered List Tag - makes an ordered list. There are 5 types of ordered lists. "1", "A", "a", "I", and "i". You can give it a type using *type="".*  (ol /ol) or (ol type="" /ol)

* Unordered List Tag - makes an unordered list. The unordered list styles I know are circle and square. There are a ton of other unordered list styles though. You can give it a style using *style="list-style-type: ;".* (ul /ul) or (ul style="list-style-type: ;" /ul)

* List Tag - used with the ordered or unordered list tag to make a list item. (li /li)

* Break/Line Break Tag - skips a line. This tag doesn't a closing tag (I think). (br)

* Link Tag - links a document to that HTML code. (link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css")

* Meta Tag - shows what characters are allowed in the code. The meta tag is self closing. (meta charset="UTF-18")

* Form Tag - the outline where everything goes. For example, inputs. (form /form)

* Input Tag - lets you input something. This is a self closing tag. (input type="type goes here" value"something here" id"id goes here")

* Label Tag - a paragraph but inline. (label /label)

* Script Tag - links a Javascript file.

## Other HTML topics: 
* Classes - gives elements a class. Classes can be applied to multiple elements. (class="example")

* IDs - gives an element an ID. IDs can only be used for one element.

* Nbsp - creates a space. (&nbsp)


## CSS:
### Properties:
* RGB - a way of giving color to an element. It stands for red, blue, green. RGB values can go up to 255 in each column. (color: rgb(red, blue, green); )

* RGBA - identical to RGB, but with a bonus feature. It stands for red blue, green, alpha(opacity). Alpha can values can range between 0 and 1. (color: rgba(red, blue, green, alpha); )

* Hexadecimal (color) - another way of giving color to an element. This method uses 16 characters: 10 numbers(0-9) and 6 alphabets(A-F). (color: #f00;)

* Color - gives an element a color. This method method uses an exisiting color. For example, red, yellow, blue, etc. (color: red;)

* Background Color - the background color. (background-color: red;)

* Width - how wide an element is. You can set the width of an element by using pixels or a percentage. (width: 200px;) or (width: 50%;)

* Height - how tall an element is. You can set the height of an element by using pixels or a percentage (although I don't use a percentage). (height: 200px;) or (height: 50%;)

* Padding - the space between the element and border. You can give an element some padding by using pixels or auto (although I don't use auto). You can also choose which way to add the padding like top, left, right, or bottom. (padding: 10px;) or (padding: auto;) or (padding-left: 10px;)

* Margin - the space between the border and outside. You can give an element some margin by using pixels or auto. You can also choose which way to add the margin like top, left, right, or bottom. (margin: 10px;) or (margin: auto;) or (margin-left: 10px;)

* Font Family - what font a piece of text has. (font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;)

* Font Size - how big the text is. (font-size: 10px;)

* Text Align - aligns a piece of text. (text-align: center;)

* Font Weight - the weight of a piece of text. (font-weight: lighter;)

* Line Height - the line height of a piece of text. This can affect the background color. (line-height: 3;)

* Border - a border. You can give an element a border by first setting the pixels, then the type of border, and then the color of the border. (border: 2px solid blue;)

* Border Radius - it's like the roundness of the corners of the border. This goes together with the border property if you want the corners to be rounder. (border-radius: 5px;)

* Text Decoration - unsure about this one, but all I know is that it can remove the underline from a link. (text-decoration: none;)

* Display - it like controls how much space is being taken. There are 3 types of "display". For example, inline only takes up space where the content is. Inline block takes up the whole line but also where the content is. Block however, takes up the whole line with no exceptions. (display: inline;)

* Cursor - how the cursor looks when hovered over a button. (cursor: pointer;)

## Other CSS topics:

* Import URL - I'm unsure at what it does, but I'm guessing it just imports a custom url to add something new to the CSS code. (@import url('https:://www․exampleurl․com'))

* Selectors - used to target an element (pseudo selectors, universal selectors, element selectors, class/id selectors)

* Pseudo Selectors - targets a special state of an element. (.button:hover{property goes inside here})

* Universal Selectors - targets everything. (*{property goes inside here})

* Element Selectors - targets an element. (h1{property goes inside here})

* Class/ID Selectors - use "." for classes and "#" for ids. (.exampleclass{property goes inside here}) or (#exampleid{property goes inside here})

## Javascript:

* Document - the whole page. (document)

* Query Selector - selects classes or ids from the page. (querySelector)

* Text Content - the content of the text. (textContent)

## Git Bash:

* If the text is *red*, git add .

* If the text is *green*, git commit -m "example message".

* If the text is *yellow*, git pull (also run it when making a new repository to merge the changes from both GitHub and local repository).

* If the text is *white*, git push.

## VS Code Shortcuts:

* Ctrl + Forward slash - makes a comment.

* Ctrl + Backslash - creates another screen with the same file.

* Alt + Left Click - selects multiple spaces.

## Bootstrap 5:

* Warning - yellow.

* Secondary - grey.

* Primary - blue.

* Success - green.

* Light - white.

* Dark - black.

* Info - cyan.

* Danger - red.

* Carousel - sliding images.

* Navbar - a navbar, but with Bootstrap.

* Card - a box with an image, then the description, and finally the button.

* Background - the background color. We use bg- to set a background color. For example bg-dark is black.

* Gradient - the gradient of the background color. We use bg-gradient to add a gradient to the background color. For example, bg-dark bg-gradient is black with a gradient.
